# DeepLearningForest Fire Detection using Deep Learning

Project Overview

This project aims to detect forest fires from images using deep learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, visualization, model building, and evaluation to deliver an efficient fire detection system.

Dataset

Source: Fire and No Fire images collected for classification tasks.The dataset includes two classes:

Fire

No Fire
